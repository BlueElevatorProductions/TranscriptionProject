# Refactoring Verification Checklist

## 🔄 Current Status

- ✅ **Switched to refactored App.tsx** (committed and pushed to GitHub)
- ✅ **Original App.tsx backed up** as `App.legacy.tsx`
- ✅ **Dependencies installed** with `--legacy-peer-deps`
- ✅ **All changes committed** to branch `feature/comprehensive-fixes-and-docs`

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Run through these tests to verify the refactored architecture works correctly:

### 1. **Basic App Launch**
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] Header displays correctly with title and buttons
- [ ] Home screen shows import button

### 2. **Audio Import Flow**
- [ ] Import dialog opens when clicking "Import Audio File"
- [ ] API key dialog works if no key is set
- [ ] File selection works
- [ ] Progress tracking displays during transcription
- [ ] Transcription completes successfully

### 3. **Speaker Identification**
- [ ] Speaker identification screen appears after transcription
- [ ] Audio samples play correctly
- [ ] Speaker names can be edited
- [ ] Proceeding to playback works

### 4. **Playback Mode**
- [ ] Audio loads and plays correctly
- [ ] Word highlighting works during playback
- [ ] Speaker names display correctly
- [ ] Mode switching to Transcript Edit works

### 5. **Transcript Edit Mode**
- [ ] Words can be edited by double-clicking
- [ ] Right-click context menu works
- [ ] Speaker changes are reflected
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality works

### 6. **Project Management**
- [ ] Save button appears when changes are made
- [ ] Project saves successfully
- [ ] Import project functionality works
- [ ] Unsaved changes warning appears

### 7. **Context State Verification**
- [ ] Audio state updates (play/pause) work across components
- [ ] Speaker updates reflect everywhere
- [ ] Segment edits persist across mode switches
- [ ] No prop drilling errors in console

## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Port conflicts**: App may start on port 5175 instead of 5174
2. **Audio state**: Should no longer see `undefined` isPlaying errors
3. **Component crashes**: All previous prop mismatch issues should be resolved

## 🔙 Rollback Instructions

If critical issues are found, rollback is simple:

```bash
# Restore original App.tsx
cp src/renderer/App.legacy.tsx src/renderer/App.tsx

# Commit the rollback
git add src/renderer/App.tsx
git commit -m "revert: rollback to original App.tsx due to issues"
git push
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

Monitor these metrics compared to the original:

1. **Initial Load Time**: Should be similar or slightly faster
2. **Re-render Frequency**: Should see fewer unnecessary re-renders
3. **Memory Usage**: Should be similar or lower
4. **Component Update Speed**: Should be faster with selective updates

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The refactoring is successful if:
- ✅ All existing functionality works without regression
- ✅ No new errors or warnings in console
- ✅ Performance is equal or better
- ✅ Development experience is improved (easier to find/modify code)

## 📝 Notes

- Context debug panel can be enabled by uncommenting line in App.tsx
- Legacy compatibility hooks are available for gradual migration
- All original functionality is preserved
- New architecture makes future features easier to implement
